title: "WSEmail Project"
excerpt: "Web services offer an opportunity to redesign a variety of older systems to exploit the advantages of a flexible, extensible, secure set of standards. WSEmail explores the objective of improving Internet messaging (email) by redesigning it as a family of web services. This promises improvements in integration, security, and flexibility compared to the legacy messaging architecture based on SMTP. Since increased flexibility often mitigates against security and performance, it is necessary to develop strategies for proving security properties and efficiently implementing WSEmail as well as exploring opportunities for its applications."

## Welcome to the WSEmail Project

### About WSEmail

Web services offer an opportunity to redesign a variety of older systems to exploit the advantages of a flexible, extensible, secure set of standards. WSEmail explores the objective of improving Internet messaging (email) by redesigning it as a family of web services. This promises improvements in integration, security, and flexibility compared to the legacy messaging architecture based on SMTP. Since increased flexibility often mitigates against security and performance, it is necessary to develop strategies for proving security properties and efficiently implementing WSEmail as well as exploring opportunities for its applications.

### Materials

A full write up of the WSEmail Project and the associated papers can be found here: [site](https://seclab.illinois.edu/wsemail).

#### Publications

The primary WSEmail paper was written by Kevin D. Lux, Michael J. May, Nayan L. Bhattad and Carl A. Gunter and is available [here](http://seclab.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/LuxMBG05.pdf). It was presented paper at the IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2005) [proc](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10245/proceeding) in Orlando, FL. Our slides [ppt](http://seclab.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/LuxMBG05.ppt) are available as well.

Our follow up extended version of the WSEmail paper was published in Service Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA) in 2020 and is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11761-019-00283-9).

#### Technical Report

In addition to the papers, Kevin, Michael, and Carl have written an extended technical report available at arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02108).
