## Topics:

This course is a followup to previous courses on network communication and systems programming. It introduces the design and implementation of **distributed systems**, systems where data, computation, and resources are distributed across a network. We will study several internet based applications which illustrate good distributed systems design.

The topics for the course include some or all of the following:

  * Distributed Computation
  * Primitives for Distributed Computation
  * Common Problems (and Solutions) for Distributed Systems
  * Techniques and Algorithms for Distributed System Design
  * Internet Communication Mechanisms (TCP/IP)
  * Existing Internet Applications
  * Client-Server Applications
  * Peer-to-Peer Applications
  * Coding Internet Applications Using TCP and UDP with Java
  * Distributed Computing Using Java
  * Coordination, Naming, and Messaging in Distributed Systems
  * Edge Computing
  * Blockchain fundamentals

### Goals

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1.  Define a distributed system and give examples of several different distributed systems paradigms.
2.  Design and implement application level communication protocols using TCP or UDP.
3.  Use an open source message queue system (RabbitMQ) for communication between computers.
4.  Use an open source distributed database system for distributed storage and retrieval of records.
5.  Use an open source framework for consensus and failure recovery (Raft) for a distributed set of servers.
6.  Explain cyber security issues related to network communication and coordination, distributed data storage, and distributed consensus and failure management.

### Academic Integrity

Cheating of any sort will not be tolerated. Student collaboration is encouraged, but within limits as set forth in the college's rules on academic integrity. Any students caught cheating will be immediately referred to the department head and the Dean and may receive a failing grade for the course.

Cheating includes:

  * Copying information, content, or verbatim text from other students, internet sites, books (other than the ones listed in the bibliography), other unaffiliated individuals to answer questions, solve problems, or aid in programming projects.
  * Copying or submitting source code, documentation, or other programming aids *without attribution* from other students, *web sites*, online repositories, text books, open source programs, or other unaffiliated individuals.
  * Project teams which submit work which is identical or substantially identical to work submitted by other project teams, whether current or from previous years.
  * Other forms of academic misconduct as described at [this link](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/) or as reasonably assessed by the instructor, program head, or dean.

If you have any questions about what constitutes cheating in the above rules, contact the instructor as early as possible.
