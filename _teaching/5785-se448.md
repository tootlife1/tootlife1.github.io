Semester 2, 5785

-----

### Course Details:

  * **Lecture and Targil:** Thursday 13:00-16:00 in Room 815
  * **Instructor:** Michael J. May
  * **Email:** mjmay (at) kinneret,ac,il

The full detailed syllabus of the course is available [here](/syllabuses/Communication-Security-Spring-5785-Syllabus.pdf).

-----

### Topics:

The topics for the course include the following:

| Threats and Security Requirements | Foundations of Modern Cryptography |
| :--- | :--- |
| Encryption and Randomness | Hash Functions |
| Authentication | Public/Private Key Pairs |
| Shared Secrets | Certificates |
| Network Security | Internet and Web Security |
| Access Control | Security Protocol Evaluation |

### Goals:

At the end of the course the student will be able to:

1.  Give proper definitions for the terms "**authenticated**", "**encrypted**", "**trustworthy**", "**secret**", "**complete**" and explain the differences between them.
2.  Properly use the following **security atoms** in application code and in designing communication protocols: cryptographic hash functions; AES and similar symmetric ciphers; RSA asymmetric cipher; RSA digital signatures; Diffie-Hellman key establishment; and Needham-Schroeder key distribution.
3.  Identify strengths and weaknesses in communication protocols under the **symbolic attacker model**.
4.  Explain the operation of **TLS** and **X.509** and use them in Java programs.
5.  Design a system that securely uses and stores passwords for authentication.
6.  Evaluate a communication security problem, derive an appropriate attacker model for it, and devise a communication security protocol which properly addresses it.

### Academic Integrity

This course will abide by Kinneret College's code of academic integrity. In particular, for individual projects and group projects, the following guidelines should be followed.

Cheating of any sort will not be tolerated. Student collaboration is encouraged, but within limits as set forth in the college's rules on academic integrity. Any students caught cheating will be immediately referred to the department head and the Dean and may receive a failing grade for the course.

Cheating includes:

  * Copying information, content, or verbatim text from other students, internet sites, books (other than the ones listed in the bibliography), other unaffiliated individuals to answer questions, solve problems, or aid in programming projects.
  * Copying or submitting source code, documentation, or other programming aids **without attribution** from other students, **web sites**, online repositories, text books, open source programs, or other unaffiliated individuals.
  * Project teams which submit work which is identical or substantially identical to work submitted by other project teams, whether current or from previous years.
  * Other forms of academic misconduct as described [here](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/) or as reasonably assessed by the instructor, program head, or dean.

If you have any questions about what constitutes cheating in the above rules, contact the instructor as early as possible.
