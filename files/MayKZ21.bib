abstract = {Digitizing cemeteries and gravestones aids cultural preservation, genealogical search, dark tourism, and historical analysis. CemoMemo, an app and associated website, enables bottom-up crowd-sourced digitization of cemeteries, categorizing and indexing of gravestone data and metadata, and offering powerful full-text and numerical search. To date,
CemoMemo has nearly 5,000 graves from over 130 cemeteries in 10 countries with the
majority being Jewish graves in Israel and the USA. We detail CemoMemo's deployment
and component models, technical attributes, and user models. CemoMemo went through
two design iterations and architectures. We detail its initial architecture and the
reasons that led to the change in architecture. To show its utility, we use CemoMemo's
data for a historical analysis of two Jewish cemeteries from a similar period, eliciting
cultural and ethnological difference between them. We present lessons learned from
developing and operating CemoMemo for over 1 year and point to future directions of
development.},
